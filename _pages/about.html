TOGETHER OUR VOICE IS STRONG! Attend a meeting - there is no charge to participate. If you decide to join, the fee is $5.00/year, and gives you a vote, in addition to your voice. You will also then be eligible to run for office as a NWDRA Board Member, or join a Committee. There are internal committees for various concerns and events. We presently have members on City Committees, including Traffic Advisory, Community Policing, and the Homeless Coalition.
